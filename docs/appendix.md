## Practical Tips:

- Where do I store my projects? I have a folder called projects close to the root folder of my pc (TODO add pic). All projects get there own folder and I clone them to here.

- Use GitHub or something like VSCode to create your initial repository rather than Git directly. This will give you the chance to add things like .gitignore files and a License file.

- Use a .gitignore file to handle large data files or sensitive information you don't want to include. (As we saw, these can be created automatically when you make a repository with GitHub or VSCode, with good defaults for a project involving for example: python or R).

- Commit regularly, it will make your life easier.

## Other Ways to Share Research Data
- Raw research data, associated with a paper, especially large data files are probably better shared using a service like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
- There is nothing wrong with having both a GitHub repository and a Zenodo page for your project.

## GitHub Alternatives
As you hopefully now appreciate, you don't need to use GitHub to make use of Git. Alternative places to host remote repositories include for example [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and they tend to offer very similar functionality.
