In this mini session we'll go through the basics of Git and GitHub. 

## Before the tutorial 

- You should have ideally created a GitHub Account, [click here to create one now if not](https://github.com) 

- You can also [setup 2 factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) for your GitHub account which is recommended. I like to use the [Google Authenticator app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&pli=1) to do this but there are many other viable options. 

## During the tutorial we'll switch back and forth between

1. [A powerpoint presentation](TODO - add link).
2. A hands on session where we can refer to this document for tips and some code blocks that we can copy-paste.

We'll begin with the powerpoint.


## After the tutorial

The best way to get comfortable with Git and GitHub is to start using them. Try it out on an existing or new project. 

I can also very strongly recommend (as I took it a while ago) this [Tutorial on Git and GitHub from Code refinery.](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/#*) These are run occasionally in Uppsala ([click here](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/) to see upcoming code refinery events). It's much more thorough than this as well.
